This project is part of the mini projects covered in "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy. 

"Guess My Number" is a simple JavaScript game where players guess a number between 1 and 20. The game features dynamic scoring, a highest score tracker, and a user-friendly interface. Players input their guesses and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game resets for a new round after each play.
